In order to run the example from this directory send the following command:

`'path to executables'/simulation_cuda -c example_config.cfg`

To run only one od the two simulation specify its index, e.g., to run only the first:

`'path to executables'/simulation_cuda -c example_config.cfg -i 0`

The example configuration file contains all the available options (not all of them mandatory)
